I am Po-Ching Hsu, a PhD student at Mechanical Engineering Department of Univeristy of Maryland, College Park. 
I'm supervised by [Dr. Radermacher](https://energy.umd.edu/clark/faculty/577/Reinhard-Radermacher) and 
[Dr. Hwang](https://enme.umd.edu/clark/faculty/549/Yunho-Hwang) @ [Center for Environmental Energy Engineering (CEEE)](https://ceee.umd.edu/). 
<br/>
<br/>
My research focuses on deep learning and machine learning modeling for HVAC systems, smart building, variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems. My PhD thesis topic is *Field Testing and Next-Generation Data-Driven Modeling for Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) Systems*.
