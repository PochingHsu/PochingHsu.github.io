I am Po-Ching Hsu, a PhD student at Mechanical Engineering Department of Univeristy of Maryland, College Park. 
I'm supervised by [Dr. Radermacher](https://energy.umd.edu/clark/faculty/577/Reinhard-Radermacher) and 
[Dr. Hwang](https://enme.umd.edu/clark/faculty/549/Yunho-Hwang) @ [Center for Environmental Energy Engineering (CEEE)](https://ceee.umd.edu/). 
<br/>
<br/>
My research focuses on deep learning and machine learning modeling for HVAC systems, smart building, variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems. My PhD thesis topic is *Field Testing and Next-Generation Data-Driven Modeling for Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) Systems*.

Interests
======
* **Energy demand analysis** <br>
As the premise of design and operation for energy systems, a robust, effective and precise enough demand prediction tool
is the critical base of following decision-making. My interest within energy demand analysis ranges from nationwide
to single building scale and hourly to annually granularity. Considering building sector takes a stable 40% share of total energy consumption from 
the [first figure](https://leigao-ceee.github.io/portfolio/energy_demand_analysis/), building energy consumption would 
be an appropriate cutting point. Specifically, on contrary to physical model, data driven method (like machine learning) 
implicitly extracts features from data. The techniques in ML area have advantages of robustness, flexibility, 
and rapidity when applying for prediction tasks. The [second figure](https://leigao-ceee.github.io/portfolio/energy_demand_analysis/) 
shows the research trend focuses on ML based building energy prediction. Right now, 
I'm trying to implement not only advanced deep learning model for prediction but also trying to interpret performance model by model.


* **Thermal system optimum design** <br>
A bottom-up optimization design framework is developed for thermal system optimization. 
With this framework, we are trying to realize end2end design, leverage more advanced cycles in terms of *E<sup>3</sup>R* 
and enable multiple objective optimization. The best thermal system considers the constraints of heat source, sink, 
component constrains. Contrary to conventional design stream with classic or expert recommended configuration. 
This framework starts with a comprehensive **C**onfiguration **O**ptimization **F**ramework for **E**nergy **E**fficiency & **E**conomics (*COFEEE*) based on graph knowledge. 
Here is an example of *COFEEE* applied for [supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> power cycle](https://leigao-ceee.github.io/portfolio/evolution_SCO2/). 
The *COFEEE* is under intensively developed for more complicated case studies.

* **System operation under uncertainty** <br>
Uncertainty issue persists around energy systems, instead of getting more accurate prediction capability, 
the more realistic strategy is to operate system with uncertainty information...

* **Disruptive innovations in HVAC area** <br>
In CEEE, various innovations are developed to improve how energy is served for human beings with minimum destruction of environment.
I was lucky to join in these projects when I was a junior PhD student, such as:<br> 
    * Thermoelastic cooling system test (participated in summer 16')<br> 
    * 3D printed miniaturized heat exchanger design & test (participated from fall 16' to spring 17')<br>
