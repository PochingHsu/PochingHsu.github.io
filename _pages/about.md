<div style="text-align: justify"> I am Lei Gao, a PhD student at Mechanical Engineering Department of Univeristy of Maryland, College Park. 
I'm supervised by <a href=https://energy.umd.edu/clark/faculty/577/Reinhard-Radermacher>Dr. Radermacher</a> and 
<a href=https://enme.umd.edu/clark/faculty/549/Yunho-Hwang>Dr. Hwang</a> @ <a href=https://ceee.umd.edu/>CEEE</a>. 
My PhD thesis topic is *Combined energy system optimum design and operation under uncertainty*.
With the goal of achieving higher Energy efficiency, lower Economic cost and fewer Environment impact without losing 
robustness (3E1R), I broaden my interest in various energy related areas, including but not limited to energy demand 
analysis, energy system optimum design, and automation via optimization & ML. I occasionally collaborate with researchers 
with interdisciplinary knowledge outside the center. </div>

Interests
======
* **Energy demand analysis** <br>
Energy consumption takes 40% of total energy consumption in US...

* **Thermal system optimum design** <br> <div style="text-align: justify"> A bottom-up optimization design framework is developed for thermal system optimization. 
With this framework, we are trying to realize end2end design, leverage more advanced cycles in terms of 3E1R and 
enable multiple objective optimization. The best thermal system considers the constraints of heat source, sink, 
component constrains. Contrary to conventional design stream with classic or expert recommended configuration. 
This framework starts with a comprehensive configuration optimization framework (COF) based on graph knowledge. 
Here is an example of COF framework applied for <a href=https://leigao-ceee.github.io/portfolio/evolution_SCO2/>
supercritical CO2 power cycle</a>. The COF is under intensively developed for more case studies. </div>

* **System operation with uncertainty** <br>
Uncertainty issue persists around energy systems, with more and Robust energy system operation under uncertainty

* **Disruptive innovations in HVAC** <br>
In CEEE, various innovations are developed to improve how energy is served for human beings with minimum destruction of environment.
I was lucky to join in these projects when I was a junior PhD student, such as:<br> 
    * Thermoelastic cooling system test (participated in summer 16')<br> 
    * Miniaturized & 3D heat exchanger design and test (participated from fall 16' to spring 17')<br>
