I am Lei Gao, a PhD student at Mechanical Engineering Department of Univeristy of Maryland, College Park. 
I'm supervised by [Dr. Radermacher](https://energy.umd.edu/clark/faculty/577/Reinhard-Radermacher) and 
[Dr. Hwang](https://enme.umd.edu/clark/faculty/549/Yunho-Hwang) @ [CEEE](https://ceee.umd.edu/). 
My PhD thesis topic is *Combined energy system design and operation by machine learning and optimization*.
With the goal of achieving higher energy efficiency, lower economic cost and fewer environment impact, 
I broaden my interest in various energy related areas, including energy system design, optimization 
and automation via AI (ML). 
I occasionally collaborate with researchers outside the center with interdisciplinary knowledge.

Research Interests
======
### Building energy analysis
Energy consumption takes 40% of total energy consumption in US...

### Thermal system design
A bottom-up optimization design framework is developed for energy conversion system...

### Energy conversion system operation
Robust energy system operation under uncertainty

### Disruptive innovations in HVAC
In CEEE, various innovations are developed to improve how energy is served for human beings with minimum destruction of environment.
I was lucky to join in these projects when I was a junior PhD student, such as:<br> 
Thermoelastic cooling system test (Summer, 16')<br> 
Miniaturized heat exchanger design and test (Fall, 16')<br> 
Low GWP refrigerant system test (Spring, 17')<br> 
Variable refrigerant flow system test (Summer, 17')<br> 
Thermal powered desalination system design (Fall, 17')<br>
