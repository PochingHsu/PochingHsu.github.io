I am Po-Ching Hsu, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park.
I'm supervised by [Dr. Reinhard Radermacher](https://energy.umd.edu/clark/faculty/577/Reinhard-Radermacher) and 
[Dr. Yunho Hwang](https://enme.umd.edu/clark/faculty/549/Yunho-Hwang) @ [Center for Environmental Energy Engineering (CEEE)](https://ceee.umd.edu/). 
<br/>
<br/>
My research focuses on deep learning and machine learning modeling for HVAC systems, smart buildings, and variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems. My Ph.D. thesis is *Experimental Investigation and Data-Driven Modeling for Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) Systems*.

Projects
======
* [**VRF systems field testing & data-driven model development**](https://pochinghsu.github.io/portfolio/VRF/) <br>
(active, independent) <br>
  - Developed a LSTM-based deep learning model for power consumption prediction of a VRF system, achieving higher accuracy (CvRMSE: 23.3%) compared to ANN and DT.
  - Applied Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, reducing optimization time compared to grid search.
  - Analyzed the impact of time delays and features on model accuracy using statistical methods, identifying the optimal time delays and features to improve model performance.
* [**Investigating the influence of air maldistribution on the performance of heat pumps**](https://pochinghsu.github.io/portfolio/air_maldistribution_acoil/)<br>
(completed, 2024, independent) <br>
  - Developed machine learning-based CFD surrogate models for predicting A-Coil air velocity profiles, achieving RMSEs of 0.046 for interpolation and 0.092 for extrapolation.
  - The predicted air velocity profiles were integrated into in-house HVAC system modeling software, resulting in a ±20% difference between simulation and test data.
  - Results showed that performance deterioration due to air maldistribution can reach up to 6.3% in capacity and 10.1% in COP.
* **Performance impact evaluation of OCR and SLHX for low-GWP refrigerants** <br>
(completed, 2024, independent) <br>
  - Examined the performance enhancement using a suction line heat exchanger (SLHX) in R454B systems through numerical and experimental analysis.
  - Investigated the oil retention behavior of R454B systems through experimental analysis.
* [**A bi-cell proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack with a magnetically driven piezoelectric actuator**](https://pochinghsu.github.io/portfolio/PEMFC/) <br>
(completed, 2017, independent) <br>
  - Developed a piezoelectric air-breathing pump for a PEM fuel cell stack, increasing power flux by 20%, reducing volume by 68%, and reducing weight by 76%.
* [**An experimental and numerical study of impinging microchannels of dielectric fluid for chip cooling**](https://pochinghsu.github.io/portfolio/impinging_microchannels_cooling/)<br>
(completed, 2015, collaborative) <br>
  - Developed and tested an impinging microchannel heatsink using two-phase dielectric fluid (FC-72) for efficient chip cooling and conducted CFD simulations to analyze flow fields with various jet orifice dimensions.
