I am Lei Gao, a PhD student at Mechanical Engineering Department of Univeristy of Maryland, College Park. 
I'm supervised by [Dr. Radermacher](https://energy.umd.edu/clark/faculty/577/Reinhard-Radermacher) and 
[Dr. Hwang](https://enme.umd.edu/clark/faculty/549/Yunho-Hwang) @ [CEEE](https://ceee.umd.edu/). 
My PhD thesis topic is *Combined energy system design and operation by machine learning and optimization*.
With the goal of achieving higher energy efficiency, lower economic cost and fewer environment impact, I broaden 
my interest in various energy related areas, including but not limited to energy system design, optimization and 
automation via AI (ML). I occasionally collaborate with researchers outside the center with interdisciplinary knowledge.

Interests
======
* **Building energy analysis**<br>
Energy consumption takes 40% of total energy consumption in US...

* **Thermal system design**<br>
A bottom-up optimization design framework is developed for energy conversion system...

* **Energy conversion system operation**<br>
Robust energy system operation under uncertainty

* **Disruptive innovations in HVAC**<br>
In CEEE, various innovations are developed to improve how energy is served for human beings with minimum destruction of environment.
I was lucky to join in these projects when I was a junior PhD student, such as:<br> 
Thermoelastic cooling system test (Summer, 16')<br> 
Miniaturized & 3D heat exchanger design and test (Fall, 16')<br>
