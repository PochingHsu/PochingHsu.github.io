This is a bar plot transfer from [Lawrence Livermore National Lab](https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/) shows energy flow change
from primary energy to end user, which indicates the consumption from building sector. It takes a stable share of 40% of 
all energy consumption.<br/><img src='/images/energy_flow18.svg'> <br/>
This is a recent journal paper distribution by data driven method from science direct for predicting energy demand of buildings. <br/>
