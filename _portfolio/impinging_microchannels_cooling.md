In this study, we developed and tested an impinging microchannel heatsink using two-phase dielectric fluid (FC-72) for efficient chip cooling and conducted CFD simulations to analyze flow fields with various jet orifice dimensions. The figure below illustrates the geometry of the microchannel heatsink in both the CFD model (symmetry) and the physical device.<br/>
