In this study, I developed a physics-informed hybrid model to predict capacity distribution and power consumption of a VRF system using field test data.<br/>

As shown below, the MPC optimization problem is formulated and solved using the developed data-driven VRF model and a nonlinear optimization tool (CasADi). The MPC results and Pareto-front analysis reveal the trade-off between energy consumption and thermal comfort (demand matching). <br/>
