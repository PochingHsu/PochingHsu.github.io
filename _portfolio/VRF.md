In this study, I developed a physics-informed hybrid model to predict capacity distribution and power consumption of a VRF system using field test data.<br/>

As shown below, LSTM outperforms ANN in VRF power prediction (CvRMSE: 23% vs. 28%) by effectively capturing time-series dependencies. It also demonstrates better tolerance to data scarcity, improving model accuracy with limited data. <br/>
