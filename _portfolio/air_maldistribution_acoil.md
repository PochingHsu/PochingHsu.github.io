In this study, I conducted a numerical analysis to evaluate the impact of air maldistribution on heat pump performance. The figure below illustrates the geometry of the microchannel A-coil in both the CFD model (symmetry) and the physical device. The machine learning-based surrogate models for rapidly predicting A-coil air velocity profiles were developed using CFD simulation data. For details on my automated CFD workflow and surrogate modeling, visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/PochingHsu/Acoil).<br/>

The predicted air velocity profiles were incorporated into in-house HVAC system modeling software to analyze performance degradation. The impact of air maldistribution on different heat pumps is presented below.<br/>
