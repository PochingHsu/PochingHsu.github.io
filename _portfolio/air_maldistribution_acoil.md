In this study, I conducted a numerical analysis to evaluate the impact of air maldistribution on heat pump performance. The figure below illustrates the geometry of the microchannel A-coil in both the CFD model (symmetry) and the physical device.<br/>

After obtaining A-coil air velocity profile data from CFD simulations, I developed machine learning-based surrogate models for fast and accurate predictions of A-coil air velocity profiles. Those interested in our automated CFD simulation, data processing workflow, and machine learning-based surrogate modeling can visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/PochingHsu/Acoil).<br/>
