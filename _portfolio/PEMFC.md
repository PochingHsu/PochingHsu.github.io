In this study, I developed a piezoelectric (PZT) air-breathing pump for a PEM fuel cell (PEMFC) stack. The figure below illustrates the working mechanism of the PZT pump alongside the CFD simulation. A nozzle/diffuser design enables unidirectional flow, ensuring adequate air supply to the fuel cell stack.<br/>
