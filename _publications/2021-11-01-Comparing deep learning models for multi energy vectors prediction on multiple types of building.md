#### Abstract
Accurate prediction of building energy consumption plays a critical role in energy sustainability. 
Most research focuses on single task prediction on one type of building, which makes model less robust 
when applied to multi energy vectors prediction on multiple building types. Meanwhile, multi vectors prediction is 
beneficial for detailed and precise management of energy supply in different buildings. 
This paper leveraged deep learning models to predict hourly-based multi energy vectors on multiple building types. 
The deep learning model is trained and tested on a large scale of datasets simulated by EnergyPlus over 
16 DOE building archetypes in 936 cities of the US. Convolutional neural network and long short-term memory models 
were constructed and compared in terms of accuracy and computation efficiency under different hyperparameter designs, 
including layers, input steps, and loss functions. Artificial neural network is the best none-deep learning model 
and chosen as the baseline for deep learning models. The results also showed that long short-term memory performs 
the best on this multi vectors prediction for both absolute and relative errors. It predicts 50.7% of the tasks from 
different building types with CVRMSE lower than 20%. A two-layer structure is good enough for the 
long short-term memory model, and it is more stable under conditions of different input steps and layer structures. 
The features reduction through principal component analysis shows a more comprehensive and ample embedding method 
should be explored. Further research should be carried out to deal with the inconsistent performance of gas-related 
energy prediction.
