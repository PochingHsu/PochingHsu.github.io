#### Abstract
Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) enables to harness waste heat resource to generate electrical power. 
R245fa is assumed as an appropriate working fluid for low-temperature waste heat recovery. 
However, strict regulations of CO2 emissions stimulate scientists to search for potential alternatives to R245fa. 
This paper presents a comparative analysis of various latest low-GWP refrigerants for ORC application.
An energetic-economic-environmental evaluation model is established and further integrated into 
the non-sorted genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) for multi-objective optimization (MOO). 
A classic decision-making method is employed to screen out the optimal refrigerant for current study. 
Apart from that, the whole-year ambient conditions in Sydney are taken into consideration to screen refrigerants. 
Comparing the cycle thermal efficiency, R1224yd(Z) leads to 3.3% higher than R245fa. 
Comparing the economic cost, it saves 10.4% more than R245fa. Comparing the whole yearâ€™s performance, 
R1224yd(Z) exhibits 11.2% higher cycle thermal efficiency than R245fa while R1234ze(Z) saves 9.85% more 
economic cost than R245fa. R1224yd(Z) is considered as the optimal working fluid for current ORC system. 
R1224yd(Z) leads to 16% higher  than R245fa. Comparing the maximum , R1224yd(Z), R1234ze(Z) and R1233zd(E) is 
16%, 9.2% and 13.5% higher than R245fa, respectively.
